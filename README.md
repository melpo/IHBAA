[I hate being an adult]

This is a series of repositories, forks and other assorted sundries to be used in the giant pain-in-the-buttocks goal of being a functional adult.

Project A is to track the absolute, monthly and yearly cost of a property

Project B is to set a schedule when to water the lawn using the rain totals and known values for how much water bermuda grass needs to thrive to hopefully cut down on the amount of watering I do
